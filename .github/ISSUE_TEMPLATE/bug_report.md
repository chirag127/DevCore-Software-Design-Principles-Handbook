# 🐛 Bug Report

Thank you for contributing to the **DevCore Software Design Principles Handbook**. By reporting bugs, you help us maintain this resource at an elite, zero-defect standard.

## 1. Core Principle Alignment

Before submitting, please verify that the issue relates to a verifiable error in the documentation, examples, or structure, and not a misunderstanding of a design principle itself. We adhere strictly to SOLID, DRY, and YAGNI principles.

## 2. Summary of the Issue

A brief, high-impact description of the bug. What is broken or incorrect?

<!-- e.g., 'The example code for the Strategy Pattern in the OOP section contains an unused variable.' -->

[ ] **Is this a documentation error?** (Typo, broken link, unclear explanation)
[ ] **Is this an example/code error?** (The code does not compile or correctly illustrate the concept)
[ ] **Is this a structural/navigation issue?** (Broken TOC, bad badge link)

## 3. Steps to Reproduce

Provide a precise, numbered sequence that allows a maintainer to replicate the error immediately.

1. Go to the file/section: `[Link to specific line/section in Handbook]`
2. Execute the following action (if applicable): `[CLI command or conceptual action]`
3. Observe the result:

## 4. Expected Behavior

What should have happened according to software engineering best practices or the description provided?

## 5. Actual Behavior

What actually happened? (Screenshots or copied text output are highly valuable here).

## 6. Environment / Context

If this relates to an external tool or standard mentioned within the Handbook (e.g., SOLID context, specific language version):

*   **Principle/Pattern:** (e.g., Open/Closed Principle)
*   **Contextual Technology:** (e.g., C#, Python, Microservices)
*   **Browser/Tool (if applicable):** (e.g., GitHub Viewer Version)

## 7. Proposed Fix (Optional but Encouraged)

If you have already identified the precise correction, please include it here. This significantly accelerates the verification and merge cycle.
